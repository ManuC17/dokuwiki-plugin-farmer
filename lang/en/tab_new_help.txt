===== Animal Creation =====

Animals are the independent subwikis of a Dokuwiki farm. To create a new animal a name has to be assigned.

==== Animal Names ====

For .htaccess based setups this should be a single word. For domain based setups you should provide either a full qualified domain name.
If you use a wildcard subdomain setup you can also just provide the hostname part if you set a base domain in the configuration.

Examples:

  * .htaccess based: ''foo'' for an animal accessible at ''%%http://example.org/dokuwiki/!foo/%%''
  * domain based: ''%%www.foo.com%%''  for an animal accessible at ''%%http://www.foo.com/%%''
  * sub domain based: ''foo''  for an animal accessible at ''%%http://foo.example.com/%%''

The latter two require the appropriate DNS setup!

==== Animal Administrator ====

The Animal will be a fully functional wiki with it's own user base. You will need at least one administrative user
to configure it. You can copy your current user or all users from the farmer or create a completely new user for the Animal.
When inheriting users from the Farmer was enabled in the configuration tab, you can also select to not create any
explicit Animal users.
